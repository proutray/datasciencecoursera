Hello! This is a repository of my work as Programming Assignment / Course Projects for the Coursera DataScience Track provided by the Johns Hopkins University.    
I upload my work into this repository **after** the completion of a course.

The intention behind this repo is: 
* Saving a copy of my work online. 
* Some work to show to potential employers who are looking to hire in the field of DataScience.

If you are a student taking the Coursera courses, I would request you to do the work on your own as that would be the only way to benefit. I think almost all of the work here was finished in a day or two each (at max.)    
Cheers,
@p_routray
